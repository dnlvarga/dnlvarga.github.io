# Session Attacks
If an attacker obtains a session identifier, this can result in session hijacking, where the attacker can essentially impersonate the victim in the web application. An attacker can obtain a session identifier through a multitude of techniques, not all of which include actively attacking the victim. A session identifier can also be:

- Captured through passive traffic/packet sniffing
- Identified in logs
- Predicted
- Brute Forced

Active attacks:
- Session Hijacking
- Session Fixation
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Open Redirects

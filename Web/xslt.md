# XSLT Server-Side Injection
XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) server-side injection is a vulnerability that arises when an attacker can manipulate XSLT transformations performed on the server.
XSLT is a language used to transform XML documents into other formats, such as HTML, and is commonly employed in web applications to generate content dynamically.

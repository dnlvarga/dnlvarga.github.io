# Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection
Similar to server-side templates, server-side includes (SSI) can be used to generate HTML responses dynamically.
SSI directives instruct the webserver to include additional content dynamically.
When an attacker can inject commands into the SSI directives, Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection can occur.

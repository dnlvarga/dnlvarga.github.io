Obtaining Command Output
With command execution possible, let's see if we can obtain any output of those commands. Let's consider the possible options for such cases:

1. Log output to console "for local testing"
2. Use a reverse shell
3. Use HTTP exfiltration (through GET parameters)
4. Use DNS exfiltration (or ping exfiltration)
5. Store the output in the database
6. Write the output to a file, then access that file
7. Inject the output into the HTTP response
8. Use sleep timers or boolean output to read the content
